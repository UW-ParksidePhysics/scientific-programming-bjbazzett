What Went Well
---
The overall understanding of the proccess and new commands

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus:
Focusing less on the exact commands and better understanding what I should type
* Communication:
Talking through the proccess and insulting myself less for making mistakes
* Pacing:
Working at the same speed, but reading more instructions fully before acting
* Division of responsibility
All me, baby
* Code quality:
Awful, absolutely horrendous. I started off by making mistakes with spelling the first directory, then having to delete it,
as well as constantly having to check to see if I was doing it right with ls because I lacked faith in the proccess.
Then with ls I discovered I never actually deleted the initial practice directory so I had to add that in at the end.
