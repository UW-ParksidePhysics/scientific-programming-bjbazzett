What Went Well

The overall start and understanding of concepts

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus:
Not getting distracted with minor errors, such as chmod not working initially
* Communication:
Not silently judging myself
* Pacing:
Working less in spurts, and more in a slow and methodical pace
* Division of responsibility
All me, baby
* Code quality:
Still needs to be improved. I edited some of the lines out because I went down a rabbit hole of asking gitbash for 'help'
when chmod didn't work properly and it would have looked REALLY messy when I copy/pasted it.
