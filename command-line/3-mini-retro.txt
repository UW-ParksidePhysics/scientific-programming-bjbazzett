The swiftness of the proccess and understanding of it

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus:
Excellent outside of the odd command 'mkdir shopping_list.txt' instead of 'mkdir practice_directory'
* Communication:
Silent as the hills
* Pacing:
Fast and *mostly* accurate
* Division of responsibility
All me, baby
* Code quality:
Messy. I doubted that I was in the right spot several times, stopping to pwd to confirm and typing ls after each file arrangement.
