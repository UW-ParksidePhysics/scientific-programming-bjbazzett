What Went Well
---
The understanding of the commands

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus:
Getting confused with other commands I forgot
* Communication:
The sounds of silence, ft Simon & Garfunkel
* Pacing:
Slow pacing, but once I understood the errors I made it went faster
* Division of responsibility
All me, baby
* Code quality:
Quite good, no messy bits of script this time. 
My gitbash did crash after the first attempt to find files with 'import numpy' but went smooth after that.
