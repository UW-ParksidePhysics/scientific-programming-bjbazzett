What Went Well
Great communication and clarification between both people


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
Agreeing more effectively on which coding to us
* Focus:
We were both focused, no distractions
* Communication:
Went well but could use a little more improvement
* Pacing:
I thought that the pace we did was reasonable and at a good rate
* Division of responsibility
Work was divided equally
* Code quality:
We did have some help with AI but overall we made it our own code and it went well
