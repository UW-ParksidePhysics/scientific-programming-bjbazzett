What Went Well

The simplicity of the commands and working from home

What Would Make Next Time 1% Better

* Focus: Not getting lost in the details of the sub commands

* Communication: The echoing voices in my head

* Pacing: Getting distracted by my dog

* Division of responsibility: All me, baby

* Code quality: Sloppy, as I misread the instuctions
